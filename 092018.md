## Overview
I used `mongoImport` to bypass my custom ETL script. Data was imported in a matter of minutes.

#### Challenge
Compose queries to aggregate and format data from separate collections.

#### Actions Taken
Use MongoDB's `aggregate` method to "join" an array of objects from `photos` as an added field in the data returned by the `reviews` collection

#### Results Observed
Works spledidly for the `/reviews` route. Data returned exactly matches the default API. Once it was workling, I was able to eliminate one stage of the query since I noticed that part of the data was never used by the inherited front-end codebase.

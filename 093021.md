## Overview

I tried to transfer my reviews database to my EC2 instance. The data transfer went fine, but re-indexing the databases has so far proved impossible. Two collections, reviews and characteristicReviews, take a prohibitively long time to index on EC2 (several hours before failure/disconnect). I cannot keep the ssh connection open long enough for the operation to complete, and I do not know how to test whether it is still running or has completed after my connection shuts down.

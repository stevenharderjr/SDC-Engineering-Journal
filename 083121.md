## Overview
Selected MySQL as the primary DB for Ratings and Reviews. Since Ratings and Reviews is a highly relational feature of this project. Each review has several sub-features that must be associated with each other. The front end of this feature gives the user a great deal of flexibility in choosing how to search, sort, display rating and review data. Using MySQL will allow me to experiment with optimizing those aspects on the back end. Perhaps most importantly, this database must efficiently service many requests from the Related Products feature, all of which are keyed to product ids. Using MySQL will allow me to fine tune relationships between tables and generate new indexes for use cases that are as yet unpredicted/unpredictable. All of this would be possible with MongoDB if I were to use multiple documents, but I know there are performance costs associated with that strategy, and it seems like a way of re-creating a relational database inside of a non-relational database. At the very least, I would expect this to add time in development.

I have only one compelling reason to stay with Mongo, and that is the requirement that reviews be searchable by keyword. I have never attempted something like that in a database, but I have a hunch that Mongo is better equipped in that regard. I am unsure whether the codebase we're using even attempts to query the API or limits keyword searching to data that has already been retrieved. This is one feature that I am very interested in trying. If there are good prospects of handling keyword search on the back end and it proves difficult to implement efficiently with MySQL, I may be forced to reconsider.

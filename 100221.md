## Overview

Another attempt at getting the DB working on EC2, which fared no better than previous attemptsâ€”I still cannot get the larger collections indexed. In the mean time, I spun up two more EC2 instances. I intend to run the server on one, which I will copy once I have it working, and install a load balancer on the other, which will receive a static IP and be the initial point of contact for the API.

## Overview
I have reversed my decision to use MySQL as my primary DBMS.

#### Challenge
I want to return an array of objects embedded in a `photos` column in response to `/reviews` queries. Apparently the only way to do this in MySQL is to aggregate the data into a single string representing a JSON object. I want to avoid this, because it would require at least one additional stage of processing (`JSON.parse`) by Node running on very weak hardware.

#### Actions Taken
Switch to MongoDB

#### Results Observed
I will have to refactor my ETL process for MongoDB

## Overview
Refactoring ETL process for MongoDB.

#### Challenge
Import several GB of CSV data into four MongoDB collections. Eliminate one collection by embedding an array of objects into the `photos` field of the `reviews` collection.

#### Actions Taken
Using Node's native `fs` methods, ingest CSV files in 10mb chunks and use MongoDB's `insertMany` method to store them in a collection.

#### Results Observed
`insertMany` is not up to the task. It assigns duplicate IDs. Based on the failure rate, I doubt that a t2.micro would even be able to hold an array of IDs for the failed insertions.

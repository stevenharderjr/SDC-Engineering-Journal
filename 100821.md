## Overview
My goal is to spin up a new t2.micro and set up an NginX load balancer in front of my other three instances.

#### Challenge
Implement load balancing

#### Actions Taken
- Installed NginX on a fresh EC2.
- This [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a41jxGP9Ic8) from NginX helped me set up the required config files.
- This [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v81CzSeiQjo) helped me set up logging so that I could verify that traffic was being rerouted to each of my server instances.

Example of nginx.conf
`upstream backend_servers {
    #ip_hash;
    server 127.0.0.1:9001;
    server 127.0.0.1:9002;
    server 127.0.0.1:9003;
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name  www.example.com;

    location / {
    proxy_pass http://backend_servers/;
    }
}`

#### Results Observed
Load balancing is working properly according to the nginx access log (`/var/log/access.log`) and the servers (accessed through the load balancer IP) are returning review data as expected. I can easily add instances and enable/disable IP hashing by adding/removing the line `ip_hash;` in my list of backend servers in `nginx.conf`
